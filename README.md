This repository is dedicated to System Engineering and DevOps, two crucial aspects of modern software development and operations. System Engineering involves designing, implementing, and managing systems that solve complex problems. DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) with the goal of shortening the system development life cycle and providing continuous delivery with high software quality.
